# Project Charter & Roadmap

## Mission Statement

**Open Embeddings aims to create a sustainable, standardized way to lower the barrier to entry for new AI agents, scripts, and services while reducing the pressure on content providers from repeated re-embedding operations across multiple models.**

## Vision

We envision an internet where content discovery is AI-native by default, where:
- Content providers can expose their material efficiently without bandwidth waste
- Developers can build semantic search applications without re-embedding costs
- End users can discover relevant content across platforms and models seamlessly
- The open internet remains accessible and avoids capture behind walled gardens

## Project Goals

### When you leave this presentation, you will hopefully understand the thesis and some of you will further:

1. **Define a great Open Format / Spec** for content-providers to leverage multiple models
2. **Update commonly used content publishing tools** to support the format securely
3. **Generate a corpus of distributed cross-space materials** to allow transitions between closed models and open model encoded data
4. **Build the Indexer(s)** - Build indexers to allow submissions of open-embeddings from anyone, with degrees of authority built-in

## Organizational Structure

- One person being doing this in their spare time
- You, if you share the vision
