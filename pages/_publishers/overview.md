# Open Embeddings for Publishers

**Scenario:** A content creator wants to provide multiple representations of their content for different AI systems.

**Solution:** The creator can:
1. Generate embeddings with different models (e.g., general-purpose, domain-specific)
2. Provide different granularities (paragraph-level, document-level)
3. Include metadata about intended use cases
4. Control how their content is represented in AI systems
