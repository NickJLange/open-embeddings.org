# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. What legal protections do embeddings have and in what countries?

    - Unknown at this time.

1. Do they inherit copyright?
    - Unknown at this time.

1. Why should the publisher pay?
    - Publishers benefit from reduced costs in bandwidth, compute, and storage by exposing their content in an AI-native format. Everyone benefits as they don't have to do the encoding, saving precious GPUs for other inference activities.

1. Is this vaporware?
    - No, this is not vaporware. This is a real project with a real specification and real use cases. We are actively working on it and welcome contributions from the community.

1. What about dynamic / updated content?
  From a certain-perspective, we want to allow Publishers to advertise embeddings - we are not enforcing a 1-1 correlation with the underlying content. We just need to make that transparent via a "dynamic-content" flag.

  As an example, http://www.nicklange.com/cookies might have 100 cookies available (before I eat them). I want to tell people that I have cookies, match on cookies, but if the actual cookies in the cookie jar are 0 - they still arrive at my site.
